# World Graphic Element (WGE)
WGE is a graphic symbol system designed globally. It enables cross - language communication and assists foreign - language reading without prior learning.

## Project Introduction
GEC has 600+. Each corresponds to a basic meaning; other meanings are expressed through combinations of multiple GECs. For example:
*  Platform+Sleep → Bed   (core word on the left)
*  Grass+close+bug → Flytrap  (Even for region-specific plant, global users instantly grasp its category (grass) and key trait (traps bugs)).

The GEC reader intelligently matches GECs above the text, allowing annotations to be viewed via mouse. Without prior learning, it can achieve bidirectional auxiliary understanding of text and GECs. Applicable to:
* Reading foreign languages ★
* Reading ancient texts and technical terms
* Children's literacy
* Communication for the hearing impaired

## Core Advantage 1: Flexibility and Freedom
Graphics offer immense variability, ensuring high flexibility
1. Open design, continuous evolution
Unlike language pronunciation, GEC shape don't restrict each other. So anyone's ideas (shapes, word combinations, rules, etc.) can be discovered and promoted by the community.
2. Flexible layout
* Text-aligned layout (implemented): see GEC reader. 
* 2D layout (In Development): Logic-based layout breaks word order constraints, enabling instant page perception and parallel thinking.

## Core Advantage 2: Simple and Efficient 
Semantic decomposition makes GECs concise, universal, abstract, and unambiguous.
1. Precise expression
Example: "舅舅"  as "uncle" is imprecise; "Brother + Mother" is exact.
2. Easy to understand
even for unfamiliar words, you can understand their categories and main characteristics via GECs combinations.
3. Concise & Memorable
With only 600+, the shape can be simplified. 
① Easy to identify: small shape, faster reading

② Associative memory: Thanks to its simple shape, GECs of the same type are more similar.

4. Simple & Fast Input
Input via categorized GEC search. Operable even by children. Average keystrokes < 20% of typing English.
Example (enter "mother"): Long press "person" → display secondary words → click "mother" with another finger. (Or long press "Mother" → display third level words and associated words)
## Core advantage 3: huge potential
For hundreds of thousands of years, the speed of human speech has hardly changed, and technological progress has made graphics have unlimited potential.
1. Physiological advantages
People's visual nerve is thousands of times that of hearing, and processing "graphics" information is much faster than "language", which is proved by the fact that mental arithmetic experts can be thousands of times faster.
2. Technical advantages
Graphic input grows ever easier. In the future, sensors will capture changes in hundreds of body parts, creating astronomical combinations. This may allow body - based input hundreds of times faster than speech.
3. Proven Effectiveness
① Global Success: Arabic numerals, punctuation, road signs, and icons transcend language barriers, boosting global communication and cognitive efficiency.
② Partial Success: Slightly graphic Chinese characters facilitate cross-language use. Printing/computing mitigated their "difficulty to write," enhancing efficiency.
Among the 117 most populous regions, the top six growth rates of GDP per capita (1960 - 2021) are Korea (used pre - 1980s), Taiwan, Singapore, China, Hong Kong, and Japan. These regions all use Chinese characters.

## Quick Start: Using GEC Reader

Usage:
Select your native language (top right) → Enter or paste any - language text in the input box → Click "Start parsing". Then, the text and GECs display side - by - side in seconds.
Query function: 
 Hover over a word: Shows its annotation.
 Hover over a GEC: Shows its meaning and design rationale.
Usage suggestion: 
Beginners: Focus on text, peripherally perceiving GECs to build associations.
Advanced Users: Use the "X%" button to mask the lower half of the text, shifting focus to GECs for graphic thinking training.

## Contribution Guide
